# Impact Methodology

## How We Measure Success

GovLink tracks several key metrics to evaluate our impact on reducing unemployment:

### Primary Metrics

1. **Total Applications Assisted**: Number of applications created or improved using GovLink
2. **Estimated Placements**: Applications that resulted in job offers (tracked via user surveys)
3. **Success Rate**: Percentage of applications leading to interviews/offers
4. **Unemployment Reduction**: Estimated impact in target regions
